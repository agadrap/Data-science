Task 1.0.
Imagine, you work at a company that wants to build a personalised music service which plays tracks depending on a number of variables: user, weather, mood, road type, etc.
Currently, we are in a very initial stage and want to understand the data, find interactions between variables.
Please do an exploratory analysis of the data, describe it, and build appropriate charts. What trends do you see? What features would you suggest to focus on?

Task 1.1.
Build a model, an initial version of a recommender system.
